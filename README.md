# Generalized Conforming Mixed Quadrilateral (GCMQ)

This repository contains the source code and example models of paper [10.1002/nme.6066](doi.org/10.1002/nme.6066).

To cite or reproduce figures in the paper, you can unzip the archive, find the corresponding figure and copy the source code in your work.

The numerical examples used in the paper are developed in `suanPan`. To perform the numerical analysis, one can download and install [`suanPan`](https://github.com/TLCFEM/suanPan). Then run the model via, for example, the following command.

```sh
suanpan -f MACNEAL.supan
```
